# Project State
I'm and going to stop develpping this project. This is due to the fact that the tutorial series I was watching diverted into a different direction then I wanted to.
They started to slack on features for different hardware and operating system. Once I learn more about LWJGL, its dependencies, 3D modeling, and graphics.
I will come back to this project. Most likely made a new project that is focused on 3D and built with C++. Since I think C++ would be a better fit for the type of project this is.
